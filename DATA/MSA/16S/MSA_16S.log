Heuristic search settings:
  Optimality criterion = parsimony
    Character-status summary:
      Of 1772 total characters:
        All characters are of type 'unord'
        All characters have equal weight
        690 characters are constant
        289 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative
        Number of parsimony-informative characters = 793
  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
  Addition sequence: simple (reference taxon = H marmor)
  Number of trees held at each step during stepwise addition = 1
  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR)
  Steepest descent option not in effect
  Initial 'MaxTrees' setting = 100
  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
  'MulTrees' option in effect
  Topological constraints not enforced
  Trees are unrooted

Heuristic search completed
   Total number of rearrangements tried = 274
   Score of best tree(s) found = 2718
